     Some comments on the code :

       • Given two points, A and B, the points that are closer to A is a half plane,
         delimited by the perpendicular bisector, and containing A.
       • So to construct the Voronoi cell of A we can take the intersection of all
         this half planes when B runs over all other points (different from A).
       • In the code, taking this intersection is done by clipping big rectangles
         that plays the role of "half planes".
       • I was not able to use \foreach because clipping inside such a loop is not
         available outside the loop (\foreach creates a group). So I'm overcoming
         this by using \xintFor.
