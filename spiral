How to create equi-distant nodes on a spiral with TikZ?

          I have borrowed the following code to draw a spiral using one of the
          existing posts in TEX.SE.

          \begin{tikzpicture}
          \draw [domain=0:25.1327,variable=\t,smooth,samples=55]
              plot[mark=*,mark options={fill=white}] ({\t r}: {0.002*\t*\t});
          \end{tikzpicture}

          enter image description here

          As seen, nodes in the resulting spiral get closer and closer as they
up vote 7 approach the center. What I'd like to have is to specify a set of
down vote nodes on the spiral that are equally distant from their adjacent
favorite  ones. That is, they do not get closer to each other towards the
2         center as in the figure above. The resulting spiral can be assumed as
          an approximation of the existing one which of course would no longer
          be looking smooth.

              Which distance is meant? The one as in the TeXample linked by Tom
          1   Bombadil and Jake’s answer (direct straight line) or along the
              path? – Qrrbrbirlbel Jun 25 '13 at 1:41

         If you don't need to reproduce your existing spiral exactly, you can use a
         path with a constant segment length and a corner angle that increases with
         the square root of the distance:

         [v4i1V]

         \documentclass[border=5mm]{standalone}

         \usepackage{tikz}

         \begin{document}
         \begin{tikzpicture}

up vote  \draw  (0,0) \foreach \t in {0.1,0.2,...,3}{
4 down     -- ++({sqrt(\t)*700}:0.4cm)
vote     };
accepted \draw [fill=white] circle [radius=1pt] (0,0) \foreach \t in {0.1,0.2,...,3}{
            ++({sqrt(\t)*700}:0.4cm) circle [radius=1pt]
         };

         \end{tikzpicture}


         \end{document}

              Based on your statement "a corner angle that increases with the square
              root of the distance" and your defined \t variable, I think \t does not
              represent any geometrical distance. What do you think of it? – kiss my

              @mozartstraße: \t is proportional to the distance travelled along the
              path, since each segment has the same length (0.4cm). – Jake Jun 25 '13

              Okey. Thank you. – kiss my armpit Jun 25 '13 at 2:11
